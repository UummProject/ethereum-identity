# Playground to understand EIP725 & EIP735

Started by forking from [Status.im implementation](https://github.com/status-im/contracts/tree/master/contracts/identity) but I end up using [nick's one](https://github.com/nick/identity), although [EIP725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735) & [EIP735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735) are both merged into one single [Identity.sol](https://github.com/UummProject/EIP725/blob/master/contracts/Identity.sol) contract


`npm install`

`npm run compile`

`ganache-cli`

`npm run go`
